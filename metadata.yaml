description: 'In The Defiant Agents, prolific science fiction writer Andre Norton
  offers up the best of both worlds: an action-packed read that is truly thought-provoking,
  as well. Subjected to an experimental procedure against their will, members of several
  ethnic groups have reverted back to the ways of their distant ancestors and are
  forced to try to survive on a primitive planet. Will they comply with the aims of
  this ethically dubious experiment, or will the test have unforeseen consequences?'
